MiSTer2MEGA65
=============

This project is taken directly from
https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65/, and my purpose here is solely to familiarize myself with how the menu structure works.
All guidance is well-written within the parent project, so please look in
there.

Font changes:
* Manually modified but it is heavily based on "Anikki-16x16"
* Fixed a few characters, to correspond to real ASCII characters
* Realigned all characters for better readability
* Changed some borders and added a new horizontal "snake" line

I have made a web color schema picker, and it is available here, http://howto.dk/MiSTer2MEGA65-Color-Schema/
